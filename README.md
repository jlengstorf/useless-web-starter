## About this project

This is a great place for a description of your project. What does it do? Where did your inspiration come from? What did you use to build it?

Adding these details helps us see more than just the final product; we want to hear your story!

## How to use this repo

To get up and running with this repo in about 30 seconds, follow these steps:

1.  [Deploy this repo to Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/jlengstorf/useless-web-starter&utm_source=useless-web-starter-steps-jl&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=devex) to create your own copy of the repo and set up automatic deployments

2.  Clone your new copy of the repo:
    
    For example, if your username is `blitzjackson` and you named the repo `useless-web`:

    ```sh
    # clone the repo
    git clone git@github.com:blitzjackson/useless-web.git

    # move into the folder
    cd useless-web/
    ```

3.  Open `index.html` in a browser to see the project.
    
    If you have `npm@5.2.0` or later, you can run `npx serve` to start a development server at `http://localhost:5000`

4.  Edit the project files to create your Useless Web project.
    
    Yeah, we know this is kind of a [“draw the rest of the owl”](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl) step, but we believe in your creativity! If you’d like to see some examples, [check out other useless projects we love](https://example.org/#TKTKuselessweb/showcase).

5.  Commit your changes and push them to GitHub:

    ```sh
    # add your files to Git staging
    git add -A

    # commit changes to Git
    git commit -m 'describe your changes here'

    # push your changes up to GitHub
    git push origin master
    ```

    You can repeat this step as often as you want.

6.  Check your [Netlify dashboard](https://app.netlify.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=useless-web-dashboard-jl&utm_campaign=devex) — the site will automatically rebuild and redeploy whenever you push changes!
